Description
This project is a Swift application developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.
TDD is an iterative development approach that emphasizes writing tests before implementing the 
actual code. The goal is to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase while 
promoting a structured and maintainable development process.
